Debugging and Profiling
***********************

These libraries help you with Python development: the debugger enables
you to step through code, analyze stack frames and set breakpoints
etc., and the profilers run code and give you a detailed breakdown of
execution times, allowing you to identify bottlenecks in your
programs.
